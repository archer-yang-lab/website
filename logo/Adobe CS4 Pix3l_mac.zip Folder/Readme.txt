Things like Flex, Distiller, Acrobat, Version Cue, Help Viewer, Device Central, and etc. aren't included. Sorry if you're one of the people that actually use those.  Just create your own version with the included Layer Style for the text. Duplicate the Photoshop background (since that's the one that I first created) and edit that one until you get the desired results. Or just duplicate the Lightroon background and invert it to create the Help Viewer icon. Anyways, you get the point. There's some way you can get the desired effect that you want whether it be Hue/Saturation or Levels and Curves adjustments.

3. About this Art
I was fooling around with a few Layer Styles and came up with a good effect that resembles Adobe's beveled text look for Creative Suite 4. So I did a few more things in Photoshop and came up with a cool pixelated background. So I made up my mind to make a CS4 iconset since there aren't very many good ones out at the moment and they'll be swarming in within weeks by creators of previous CS3 replacement icons. (No offense if you're planning to make a CS4 iconset.)

While I was working on the very repetitive task of simulating the colors of the CS icons, I thought "Why not make it Open Source? People would love to take a look at how I work as well." And so I decided to give away the PSD to the masses for modification.

So even if you don't own Photoshop or don't want to modify the icons, I still rendered out all the icons in 512x512 .PNG ONLY since I hate 256x256, 128x128, and 16x16. Not to mention I consider it Illegal to use icons that small. In retrospect, I should've did these in 1024x1024 but it doesn't matter since there's not that much detail in them. After all, it's a simple CS icon.

By the way, the PSD layers don't have drop shadows. So you'll just have to make your own with a Layer Style. I did this purposely so people could keep the proportions of choice for their variants of the iconset.

4. Layers
Okay, so upon opening the PSD and expanding the groups, you might want to do something like modify the Premiere Pro icon. To do this, make sure you turn on the visibility for the Background layer named "Premiere", the Periodic Table Text layer named "Premiere" and another text layer named Pro. Same thing with After Effects CS4 Pro and Photoshop CS4 Extended.

5. Legal and Publicity
Alright, let's get this straight m'kay?
You can modify these icons however you see fit UNDER THE FOLLOWING STIPULATIONS.

-You are NOT allowed to place ANY watermark or logo on these icons.
-You are NOT allowed to place your name on the icons
-You are NOT allowed to take credit for creating them (Because, well... you didn't.)
-If you use them in a video, or screenshot, please provide a link in the description to download them
-You DON'T have to modify them if you don't want to. If you're the kind of person that likes to screw around with PSD layers then that's fine. Study the icon as much as you want.
-You may NOT use these icons for ANY commercial use (If these icons are leaving the computer screen for the big screen, you need to contact me first.)
-You may NOT SELL THESE ICONS. I didn't get any money for making them, so you shouldn't get any for modding them.
-If you're unsure of what you're allowed to do with these icons, send me an email first.

6. Final Thoughts
Well, I am proud of myself if I do say so. I don't know if I'll do another iconset. If I do, it'll be by accident the same way my glass CS3 iconset was. Thanks for downloading these icons and reading this readme. Now go forth and launch your applications!


Made with Photoshop CS3 ;D
