= MATH 680: Computation Intensive Statistics

=== Fall 2019

*Instructor*: Yi Yang \n
*Office*: Burnside 1241\n
*Email*: yi.yang6@mcgill.ca\n
*Website*: www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/\n
*Lecture meeting time*: M, W 3:35 pm – 4:55 pm in Burnside 708\n
*Office Hour*: M, W 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm in Burnside 1241\n
*Prerequisites*: MATH 556, MATH 557 or permission of instructor\n

=== Grading

The homework assignments are worth 65\% of the course grade, the project is worth 30% of the course grade, and class participation is worth 5\%.



=== Course project

There will be a course project, with two milestones, a final report, and a class conference. Students are required to complete a course project. 2 students can form a team, the report must specify their individual contribution in their team project. The projects are selected by the students and require approval from the instructor. The team will present their project in class and a written technical report must be submitted by Dec 3. More information will be given during October.

=== Policy on collaboration

Collaboration on homework assignments with fellow students is encouraged. However, such collaboration should be clearly acknowledged, by listing the names of the students with whom you have had discussions concerning your solution.

=== Programming languages

No restriction.
